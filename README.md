# Basic-Exercise-Number-60
This simple console program is a C# exercise I found on w3resource.com/csharp-exercises.

"Write a C# program to calculate the sum of all the integers of a rectangular matrix except those integers which are located below an intger of value 0."

The program accomplishes this using a predefined set of integers, in this case the integers given in the question's example.
